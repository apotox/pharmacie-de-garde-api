Navigating a new codebase can be challenging, so we're making that a little easier. As you're using this project, you may come across an ```.js``` file that you want to make an update/fix to. You can click on the **make a contribution** button right on that file, which will take you to the file in this repo where you'll make your changes.

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/apotox/pharmacie-de-garde-api/issues) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one
